<title>Authentication and Authorization</title>
<simpara>Authentication and authorization are two very related, and yet separate,
concepts. While the former deals with identifying a user, the latter determines
what a user is allowed to do. Unfortunately, since both terms are often
abbreviated as "auth," the concepts are often conflated.</simpara>
<simpara>Yesod provides built-in support for a number of third-party authentication
systems, such as OpenID, BrowserID and OAuth. These are systems where your
application trusts some external system for validating a user&#8217;s credentials.
Additionally, there is support for more commonly used username/password and
email/password systems. The former route ensures simplicity for users (no new
passwords to remember) and implementors (no need to deal with an entire
security architecture), while the latter gives the developer more control.</simpara>
<simpara>On the authorization side, we are able to take advantage of REST and type-safe
URLs to create simple, declarative systems. Additionally, since all
authorization code is written in Haskell, you have the full flexibility of the
language at your disposal.</simpara>
<simpara>This chapter will cover how to set up an "auth" solution in Yesod and discuss
some trade-offs in the different authentication options.</simpara>
<section id="authentication-and-authorization_overview">
<title>Overview</title>
<simpara>The yesod-auth package provides a unified interface for a number of different
authentication plugins. The only real requirement for these backends is that
they identify a user based on some unique string. In OpenID, for instance, this
would be the actual OpenID value. In BrowserID, it&#8217;s the email address. For
HashDB (which uses a database of hashed passwords), it&#8217;s the username.</simpara>
<simpara>Each authentication plugin provides its own system for logging in, whether it
be via passing tokens with an external site or an email/password form. After a
successful login, the plugin sets a value in the user&#8217;s session to indicate
his/her <literal>AuthId</literal>. This <literal>AuthId</literal> is usually a Persistent ID from a table used
for keeping track of users.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a few functions available for querying a user&#8217;s <literal>AuthId</literal>, most
commonly <literal>maybeAuthId</literal>, <literal>requireAuthId</literal>, <literal>maybeAuth</literal> and <literal>requireAuth</literal>. The
&#8220;require&#8221; versions will redirect to a login page if the user is not logged in,
while the second set of functions (the ones <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> ending in <literal>Id</literal>) give both the
table ID <emphasis>and</emphasis> entity value.</simpara>
<simpara>Since all of the storage of <literal>AuthId</literal> is built on top of sessions, all of the
rules from there apply. In particular, the data is stored in an encrypted,
HMACed client cookie, which automatically times out after a certain configurable
period of inactivity. Additionally, since there is no server-side component to sessions,
logging out simply deletes the data from the session cookie; if a user reuses an
older cookie value, the session will still be valid.</simpara>
<note><simpara>You can replace the default client-side sessions with server side
sessions, to provide a forced logout capability, if this is desired.  Also, if
you wish to secure your sessions from man in the middle (MITM) attacks, you
should serve your site over SSL and harden your sessions via <literal>sslOnlySessions</literal>
and <literal>sslOnlyMiddleware</literal>, as described in the sessions chapter.</simpara></note>
<simpara>On the flip side, authorization is handled by a few methods inside the <literal>Yesod</literal>
typeclass. For every request, these methods are run to determine if access
should be allowed, denied, or if the user needs to be authenticated. By
default, these methods allow access for every request. Alternatively, you can
implement authorization in a more ad-hoc way by adding calls to <literal>requireAuth</literal>
and the like within individual handler functions, though this undermines many
of the benefits of a declarative authorization system.</simpara>

<simpara>We&#8217;ll start with the route declarations. First, we declare our standard <literal>HomeR</literal>
route, and then we set up the authentication subsite. Remember that a subsite
needs four parameters: the path to the subsite, the route name, the subsite
name, and a function to get the subsite value. In other words, based on the
line:</simpara>
<programlisting language="routes" linenumbering="unnumbered">/auth AuthR Auth getAuth</programlisting>
<simpara>We need to have <literal>getAuth :&#58; MyAuthSite &#8594; Auth</literal>. While we haven&#8217;t written
that function ourselves, yesod-auth provides it automatically. With other
subsites (like static files), we provide configuration settings in the subsite
value, and therefore need to specify the get function. In the auth subsite, we
specify these settings in a separate typeclass, <literal>YesodAuth</literal>.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Why not use the subsite value? There are a number of settings we would
like to give for an auth subsite, and doing so from a record type would be
inconvenient. Also, since we want to have an <literal>AuthId</literal> associated type, a
typeclass is more natural. And why not use a typeclass for all
subsites? It comes with a downside: you can then only have a single instance
per site, disallowing serving different sets of static files from different
routes. Also, the subsite value works better when we want to load data at app
initialization.</simpara></note>
<simpara>So what exactly goes in this <literal>YesodAuth</literal> instance? There are five required declarations:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>AuthId</literal> is an associated type. This is the value <literal>yesod-auth</literal> will give you
  when you ask if a user is logged in (via <literal>maybeAuthId</literal> or <literal>requireAuthId</literal>).
  In our case, we&#8217;re simply using <literal>Text</literal>, to store the raw identifier- email
  address in our case, as we&#8217;ll soon see.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>authenticate</literal> gets the actual <literal>AuthId</literal> from the <literal>Creds</literal> (credentials) data
  type. This type has three pieces of information: the authentication backend
  used (googleemail in our case), the actual identifier, and an
  associated list of arbitrary extra information. Each backend provides
  different extra information; see their docs for more information.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>loginDest</literal> gives the route to redirect to after a successful login.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Likewise, <literal>logoutDest</literal> gives the route to redirect to after a logout.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>authPlugins</literal> is a list of individual authentication backends to use. In our example, we&#8217;re using Google OAuth, which authenticates a user using their Google account.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In addition to these five methods, there are other methods available to control
other behavior of the authentication system, such as what the login page looks
like. For more information, please
<ulink url="https://www.stackage.org/package/yesod-auth">see the API documentation</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>In our <literal>HomeR</literal> handler, we have some simple links to the login and logout
pages, depending on whether or not the user is logged in. Notice how we
construct these subsite links: first we give the subsite route name (<literal>AuthR</literal>),
followed by the route within the subsite (<literal>LoginR</literal> and <literal>LogoutR</literal>).</simpara>
</section>
<section id="authentication-and-authorization_email">
<title>Email</title>
<simpara>For many use cases, third-party authentication of email will be sufficient.
Occasionally, you&#8217;ll want users to create passwords on your site. The
scaffolded site does not include this setup, because:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
In order to securely accept passwords, you need to be running over SSL. Many
  users are not serving their sites over SSL.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
While the email backend properly salts and hashes passwords, a compromised
  database could still be problematic. Again, we make no assumptions that Yesod
  users are following secure deployment practices.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
You need to have a working system for sending email. Many web servers these
  days are not equipped to deal with all of the spam protection measures used
  by mail servers.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><simpara>The example below will use the system&#8217;s built-in <emphasis>sendmail</emphasis> executable.
If you would like to avoid the hassle of dealing with an email server yourself,
you can use Amazon SES. There is a package called
<ulink url="https://www.stackage.org/package/mime-mail-ses">mime-mail-ses</ulink> which
provides a drop-in replacement for the sendmail code used below. This is the
approach I generally recommend, and what I use on most of my sites, including
FP Haskell Center and Haskellers.com.</simpara></note>
<simpara>But assuming you are able to meet these demands, and you want to have a
separate password login specifically for your site, Yesod offers a built-in
backend. It requires quite a bit of code to set up, since it needs to store
passwords securely in the database and send a number of different emails to
users (verify account, password retrieval, etc.).</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s have a look at a site that provides email authentication, storing
passwords in a Persistent SQLite database.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Even if you don&#8217;t have an email server, for debugging purposes the
verification link is printed in the console.</simpara></note>

<simpara>What&#8217;s convenient about the body of <literal>isAuthorized</literal> is that you can run any
<literal>Handler</literal> code you want. This means you can:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Access the filesystem (normal IO)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Lookup values in the database
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Pull any session or request values you want
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Using these techniques, you can develop as sophisticated an authorization
system as you like, or even tie into existing systems used by your
organization.</simpara>
